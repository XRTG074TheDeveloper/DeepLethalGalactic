## Introduction

<i>Hello there Miner,

I am pleased to announce that our management is looking forward to sign a partnership contract with our new friends from a "Thistle Nebula" in order to (guess what) make more profit.
It seems that our new partners are collecting different goodies from abonded savage planets usually inhabited by very deadly creatures. 
Yet, it should be easy for you to handle this because you have a lot of experience in killing Hoxxes IV fauna (at least I hope so).

Rock and Stone!

Mission Control. Signing off.</i>

## Mod Features

### Missions

The DLG mod will bring many different missions to the game, which will completely change the gameplay and the main goal of each round.
You no longer need to look for scrap and be afraid that you will not meet the quota, the only thing you really need to worry about is the goal of the mission.

### Swarms

What could be better than facing a crowd of deadly enemies at the most inopportune moment?
It's not easy to kill mobs from a Lethal Company, but what if 10 of them are already heading straight for you?

### Weapons

In fact, I don't plan to add any custom weapons yet, because I'm quite new to game modding, so the best friend of every single employee is the double-barreled shotgun and a shovel.
However, different overclocks that can be purchased from terminal can take place in this mod.

### Mobs

No any glyphids for now. The reason is stated above.

### Time threat

The longer you stay on the planet, the higher challenge you will face.
Moreover, when time will reach its critical point the ship will leave planet, your mission will be failed and you will be left on the planet.
Although, the management won't let you leave the planet unless your mission is finished.

### Dwarves

I know that absolutely all fans of Deep Rock Galactic want to play as a driller in Lethal Company and destroy everyone and everything, but this is might be really hard (let me repeat - I'm quite new to game modding)

> All mod features described above are already added or will be added soon!
